17,"While they can seem pointless and purely irritating to us humans, mosquitoes do play a substantial role in the ecosystem.",True
18,"Mosquitoes form an important source of biomass in the food chain—serving as food for fish as larvae and for birds, bats and frogs as adult flies—and some species are important pollinators.",True
19,"Without mosquitoes, thousands of plant species would lose a group of pollinators.",True
20,"Well, back in the early 90s it travelled down copper phone wires.",True
21,This had a lot of limitations on how much information could be sent.,True
22,"From there there's been technology to use fibre optic cables, coaxial cables used by pay TV and so on.",True
23,These allow more bandwidth.,True
24,Not to mention that tricks were worked out to send more information at the same time down the same things including copper phone lines.,True
25,Using copper lines you went from dial up to DSL to ADSL as they worked out ways to get more bandwidth out of it.,True
26,There's also the issue of what is being used to deliver the last little distance of internet to your house.,True
27,It can be all amazing fibre optics to your suburb or neighbourhood but then if the last little bit of distance is old technology that will greatly slow down how much you can get out of it.,True
28,Australia has seen this as a massive issue as our infrastructure has been upgraded it was mostly done to a node in a neighbourhood and then the last little bit of distance is shit.,True
29,"And of course computer technology has increased so the various hubs and nodes and whatever along the way can process the information faster today to reroute it, etc than they could in the past.",True
30,"In a nutshell he revealed data that showed that the US government, and multiple allied governments had the ability to do things like listen to everyone's phone calls, read their texts, their emails, follow their internet searches, track their locations (via GPS in phones) and also remotely activate people's cell phone cameras and microphones to listen and see what people are doing in real time.",True
31,"In short, it was estimated that the data revealed that the US and it's allies had transparency into roughly 80% of all digital communications in the US.",True
32,"It's less that this was ""Bad"" honestly, more that these agencies shouldn't have been doing A. to US Citizens, and B. on US soil and C. that the major data providers, the Verizons, AT&Ts, etc, were providing the ""keys"" to their networks for the government to provide this access.",True
33,"I think you’re getting confused between acronyms… peer to peer (like bit torrent) is an application layer protocol, which runs over your normal internet connection.",True
34,"Your pc connects to many peers to share content

Point to point, is a network connection type that involves just two endpoints, eg your old dial up modem has a point to point connection with your ISP.",True
35,"That’s a network layer concept and IP (internet protocol) may run over that connection, or not.",True
36,More recently the term is used to describe wireless or laser links which provide line of sign networking between buildings or between a central tower and a number of receiver stations,True
37,Data and sound are very low energy signals.,True
38,The device that picks up the signal has to use electrical power to amplify the signal before they can do anything with it.,True
39,"That's why in the old days, a radio was a giant appliance that took up half your living room - before transistors were invented, the hardware to amplify the radio signal was quite bulky and needed a lot of space.",True
40,"If we were to send enough electricity wirelessly to actually power devices, there would be significant human health risks.",True
41,"It is something that physicists are working on, but we can't just crank our radio antennas up to maximum power without giving cancer to everyone near the antenna.",True

43,"2.5d can mean either:

3d environment with 2d movement

3d movement with 2d projections and elements.",True
44,Either is 2.5d as each uses a 2d something AND a 3d something.,True
45,"In an fps, it's usually referring to 3d movement with 2d sprites akin to good old doom.",True
46,"In something like a platformer, this might mean fully 3d environments, but you can only move left, right, up, and down along a 2d plane.",True
47,Electrons are always present.,True
48,What we think of as electricity is the movement or flow of electrons.,True
49,Like the difference between a bucket of water and water flowing through a pipe.,True

51,Electric generation involves adding movement to the electrons.,True
52,Solar panels use sun's energy to stimulate the electrons in the panel and get them moving.,True
53,A spinning motor uses moving magnets to push electrons around.,True
54,"There are also chemical methods, most often seen in batteries, which essentially use two different containers of chemicals, one container with a lot of electrons and another container with very few electrons.",True
55,Due to natural forces the electrons will try to move from the crowded space to the less crowded space.,True
56,A wire in between allows the electrons to flow from one side to the other.,True
57,This is also how living organisms produce electricity such as in human nerves.,True
58,Another method is piezoelectricity which is fairly complex but can be thought of as special materials pumping electrons around when they are squeezed and released.,True
59,Thorium has a number of potential advantages as a fuel source for nuclear reactors.,True
60,"It's far more abundant on Earth than Uranium, and more stable (from a nuclear perspective).",True
61,To the point where we have been stockpiling it as waste from mining because we have no other commercial use for it.,True
62,Thorium doesn't require high pressures compared to modern Uranium reactors so it could be made into safer reactors that don't require as many safe guards.,True
63,This reduces costs and makes them more suitable for operation in 3rd world countries.,True
64,It's waste products aren't as dangerous and don't require long term cooling and containment.,True
65,"It's also a very poor source of fissile material, in other words the bi-products of Thorium reactors can't be made into nuclear weapons.",True
66,This makes the sale of Thorium reactors to other countries far more practical politically.,True
67,So why don't we make them?,True
68,"Billions of dollars of research and development money would be required, and the main source of that would have to be Western Governments.",True
69,But Governments like the US have previous shown no interest in Thorium as a nuclear fuel... because you can't make nuclear weapons out of the by-products.,True
70,This made the RnD for Thorium during the cold war politically undesirable.,True
71,"At this point it would be a good source for Green(er) energy, but most of the safe money is betting on Nuclear Fusion reactors instead.",True
72,All modern phones are completely digital these days.,True
73,Everything is transmitted as 1s and 0s.,True
74,"When you speak into a cellphone, a tiny microphone in the handset converts the up-and-down sounds of your voice into a corresponding up-and-down pattern of electrical signals (think record into mp3).",True
75,A microchip inside the phone turns these signals into strings of numbers.,True
76,"The numbers are packed up into a radio wave (like your car radio signal, but much more secure) and beamed out from the phone's antenna.",True

78,Depends on the raid level.,True
79,"Raid 0 is just spreading data among multiple drives, with the goal of improving speeds (since read/write tasks will be split among drives).",True
80,However there is zero redundancy: a single drive loss will cause a complete loss of data.,True
81,Raid 1 is purely mirroring among drives: there is no performance improvement in write tasks since all data must be written identically to multiple drives.,True
82,"However even in a two drive array, a single loss results in no data loss.",True
83,"Raid 5 is a bit of both: data is spread among drives, but the equivalent to one drive's space is used for redundancy, allowing a single drive in a 3+ drive array to be lost without losing data.",True
84,"Many carriers, each with a narrow band, means that they individually have a low data rate.",True
85,"This makes them less susceptible to various common forms of corruption in the signal, particularly what's called ""multipath"".",True
86,"That's when the signal arrives both directly and also via reflections off other objects, so you get the same signal arriving with varying amounts of delay.",True
87,"The data being carried by such a signal get smeared out and, at high data rates, earlier bits can interfere with later bits in the same signal.",True
88,Having a very low data rate means that each bit is spaced far enough apart that multipath is much less of an issue.,True
89,It's a part of the operating system for a computer.,True
90,"In particular, it's used by Windows OS.",True
91,"These days, you can't delete system32 unless you're using a secondary OS, from a boot disk or a flash drive, since you can't delete it while Windows is in operation.",True
92,"On modern OS-es you can program what the power button does, if you set it to send a shutdown command it is the same like pressing start > shutdown.",True
93,"(i think windows is set to do that out of the box)

People say its bad because it was bad to do it on really old PCs (It would shutdown immediately and could lead to file corruption)",True
94,It was chosen because it’s easy to multiply and divide the voltage with transformers.,True
95,"The voltage can be raised very high to transmit over long distances with minimal loss to cable resistance..  then dropped back down for distribution in neighborhoods, then again to feed homes.",True
96,There are languages like Verilog/VHDL that help out with most of it.,True
97,"You write the design in a language like any other programming language and a program will compile it down to a design

Edit 1: For context, an entire assignment of one class I had back in college was to code up an entire processor using Verilog that ran custom instructions.",True
98,The professor then would run your processor with a set of instructions (unique for each student) and you had to get the right result to get a good grade.,True
99,"Edit 2: yes, there are other ways ICs and processors are made.",True
100,This is one.,True
101,Software running on a a totally closed system will not generate new software bugs.,True
102,"Examples might include old-school arcade games, appliances like a microwave oven, and old digital watches.",True
103,These systems might show new errors as the hardware gets old and fails in ways the software was never written to handle.,True
104,But any software that has to talk to other software will show new bugs over time because the writers of the code could not predict every possible new change.,True
105,"ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) controls the ""root name servers"", the servers for each top level domain (e.g.",True
106,.gov or .com) hold the authoritative lists of what other servers are allowed to be name servers for that top level domain.,True
107,"The name servers are the ones that say that ""[randomperson.com](https://randomperson.com)"" belongs to you and not me.",True
108,They are generally operated by the domain registry companies (e.g.,True
109,GoDaddy).,True
110,"There is no one, single, universally accepted directory of URLs.",True
111,It's spread across many servers & databases.,True
112,"There \*is\* one universally accepted protocol for how to decide who controls what, and that's run by ICANN.",True

114,"It didn't \*become\* the only table of contents, it \*is\* the only table of contents.",True
115,"Movies (and some, but not all modern US TV shows tend to be shot at 24 frames a second)

British TV runs at 50hz thus to fit nicely in with the refresh rate they play the movie at 25fps.",True
116,"This results in a tiny speed increase, and also audio pitch shifting up ever so slightly.",True
117,"""Trust"" is used by computer security professionals to be an analog for the colloquial concept.",True
118,"If some protocol can establish trust, that means when someone makes claims to you over the protocol, you can believe them.",True
119,"For example, HTTPS has trusted identity - if you connect to the website reddit.com HTTPS, you can trust that the data is being produced by a server owned by the organization reddit.",True
120,"(of course, HTTPS, like any other protocols, do not establish this trust perfectly - you have to make certain assumptions, like your computer, reddit, and the HTTPS certificate authorities not being compromised)

""Internet of trusted things"" is a marketing slogan used by a few organizations, which claims to add this kind of trust to IoT technology.",True
121,"This would mean that if you get some data from your IoT device, or your IoT device receives a command from you, both sides can trust that the information actually came from the party that claims it, and has not been manipulated.",True
122,"There is no single set of technologies it refers to, as there are many issues that cause IoT to be untrustworthy, and many solutions for each issue - different organizations use it differently for their own purposes.",True
123,"Often we use a metaphor of a computer as a desk, and you can place things on the desk in order to work on them and put them in the filing cabinet when you're done.",True
124,"I could say that the process of booting up is like taking things out of the filing cabinet and putting them on the desk, getting out your utensils, and sitting down to work.",True
125,"But you might say, why can't we leave the computer like this even when it's turned off?",True
126,"Well, imagine that the desktop isn't actually flat.",True
127,"Instead, it's a non-magnetic blackboard, and the only way you can actually get work done is by having specially trained monkeys hold all of the papers flat against the blackboard.",True
128,"As soon as the monkeys stop working, all of the papers that haven't been put away fall straight off the blackboard.",True
129,"And honestly, you want the monkeys to do more things than just hold paper to the blackboard, sometimes you want them to take the papers over to the copy room to print things, or sometimes you want to have the monkeys take papers to another person down the hall, or something entirely different.",True
130,"The reason it takes a computer time to turn on is because it takes the monkeys a certain amount of time to figure out what kind of papers they're going to be working with today, where they need to put them, and what kinds of things they're going to need to do with them.",True
131,"The monkeys probably also should check to make sure there are aren't any monkeys missing work today, or maybe the desk has changed size.",True
132,"A lot of that work has to be done by a supervisor monkey (whose name is BIOS) who has to be woken up first before he can wake up any other monkeys, and waking up the supervisor monkey takes a certain amount of time too.",True

147,"EULA's tend to include lots of clauses that aren't legally enforceable, but most people don't have the resources to fight them.",True
148,So a platform can sometimes just notify a user that they have to change their username.,True
149,Doesn't matter that the user got to it first.,True
150,So long as they preserve the user's content the user won't have much standing if they haven't built a revenue stream using that name that allows them to demonstrate real harm in a court case.,True
151,Or the celebrity/brand can reach out to the user and ask for it.,True
152,Possibly offering money for the release.,True
153,They would work with the platform to swap the username without transferring any content over.,True
154,Or the platform can look at the account to determine if its still in use and just delete the old one and reissue to the new requestor.,True

158,"""The Cloud is just someone else's server""

Cloud computing means that you are renting time on servers and software from somebody else.",True
159,The advantage to a business is that you don't have to maintain your own hardware and software in house which simplifies things and potentially saves money.,True
160,Also at least theoretically you don't need to have as highly skilled IT people working for you because the Cloud provider takes care of that.,True
161,You also have the ability to spin up and spin down new systems on-demand which adds a lot of flexibility to your environment.,True
162,"But that's not always the case, and many businesses get caught out by the promise of the Cloud due to clever marketing.",True
163,"On the other side Cloud computing can also be **more** expensive than maintaining equipment onsite depending on various factors, and it doesn't remove the need for IT people it just changes what skills they need to have.",True
164,"We call this moving the burden upwards, for example instead of needing a team of 3 guys that know the hardware and software you switch to needing 2 guys that know Cloud and since that's harder to come by it costs you a lot more in labor.",True
165,Cloud based models are leasing models so your business doesn't own any assets which can be good or bad depending on how you look at it.,True
166,A bit is like a switch it is either on it off/1 or 0.,True
167,A byte is a collection of 8 bits and is usually used to store a number either 0-255 or -127-+128,True

169,A browser parses the HTML text from a webpage and displays it accordingly in the browser so that it looks like it's expected regardless of what computer you're on.,True
170,Or if you're a blind reader a program can parse the HTML to read you the information on the page.,True
171,Typing on a regular keyboard is slower than speaking so doesn’t work in a court setting.,True
172,Stenography machines work by typing syllables using multiple keys at once instead of each key being one letter.,True
173,"So instead of typing 11 letters one at a time for Stenography, you’d type four chords for sten, awg, ruff, and ee.",True
174,Then later that phonetic version gets transcribed back into normal spellings.,True
175,Having the pilot on board means A) not needing to worry about lag or disruptions in communications and B) being able to look around and feel what's going on.,True
176,"For the former, connections between ground stations and drones aren't always perfect.",True
177,"Signals can get disrupted, either unintentionally or intentionally.",True
178,"When it's just a UAV patrolling around secured airspace a 2-10 second drop in signal just means the UAV keeps flying in circles, but in a craft responsible for air superiority a 2 second blip in a dogfight means the signal is probably never coming back.",True
179,"For the latter, having the ability to turn your head and see another direction is critically important.",True
180,"While you could put enough cameras on a plane to relay a full 360 degree view to a ground station, doing so means needing to maintain extreme high bandwith connections in sub-optimum conditions, versus a conventional drone where you just need enough bandwidth for a few sensor feeds and signal relays.",True
181,"Alternately, you choke down the amount of information the drone controller gets, leaving them at a relative disadvantage against a live pilot.",True
182,"SDR content uses generally 24 bits of information to represent the brightness and color of each pixel (8 bits each for red, green, and blue sub pixels).",True
183,"HDR allocates more bits (30 or 32 bits per pixel, for HDR10 and Dolby Vision) allowing for more distinct brightness and color values to be represented.",True
184,This means you have enough info to encode a wider dynamic range (difference between the brightest white and pure black) without losing out on subtle differences between colors and shades.,True
185,"TLDR: HDR content on an HDR TV can have really bright scenes and really dark scenes, without either getting washed out",True
186,"Simply put, they shake the air which carry to your ears which your brain interprets as sound.",True
187,All that sound is is vibration in the air.,True
188,"A microphone records the vibrations, whereas a speaker (or headphones) use the magnets (and other bits) to shake the speaker cone in a manner that perfectly recreates those vibrations, producing sound.",True
189,"[Kernel Panic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_panic)

For those that don't want to click the link, here is a simplified, not quite ELI5 answer:

A kernel panic, also known as a fatal system error, is when the most fundamental part of the operating system runs into a problem or error it cannot fix.",True
190,How the system deals with this varies depending on operating system.,True
191,The action most people are familiar with would be the infamous Blue Screen Of Death or BSOD on a Windows computer.,True

193,"What causes them can vary, but common causes are:

1) Corrupted RAM

2) Corrupted kernel data as read from the hard drive.",True
194,"3) bugs in the kernel or core set of drivers

4) hardware failures.",True
195,"If the cause is just corrupted data, sometimes rebooting is all you need to do to fix the problem.",True
196,"This is because during a reboot, the system basically throws away all the data it has stored in RAM and may also throw away all data in the cache portion of the storage device.",True
197,It then reads the data from storage and starts everything anew.,True
198,"In cases where this is caused by a bug in software, sometimes the reboot will bring you back up to a restricted mode that only runs the absolute minimum of stuff.",True
199,Typically called Safe Mode.,True
200,"Other times, you can force the rebooting system to go into Safe Mode by some input during the boot process.",True
201,"(on an Apple phone, you hold power and home buttons, on  Windows PCs, you use the F8 key) 

The safe mode allows you uninstall a program or driver that may be causing the problem.",True
202,"With a mirror, every single photon of light that hits it bounces back at the same angle at which it hit the mirror (we say the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection).",True
203,"This means if all the light off of one object was travelling parallel to each other, it would continue travelling parallel after bouncing off the mirror.",True
204,This is what allows it to preserve the image.,True
205,"With something like a retroreflective vest, there's something else happening on top of that.",True
206,A retroreflector is a special shape consisting of multiple mirrors.,True
207,"The light that comes in will always be reflected on the exact same trajectory back towards the source, albeit just a little offset.",True
208,"For example, there are retroreflector panels on the moon that were left by the Apollo astronauts.",True
209,"If you were to shoot a laser at them from the north pole, the light would return to the north pole.",True
210,"If you shot a laser at it from the south pole, the light would return to the south pole.",True
211,"Now a retroreflective vest won't be a perfect retroreflector, since their job is to get light to a driver from a car, but the basic principal is the same -- redirect all the incoming light back to where it came from... and up a little bit into the driver.",True
212,A microprocessor generally has external memory and no onboard specialized I/O.,True
213,"A microcontroller typically has onboard memory and often specialized I/O such as serial interface, general purpose input or output pins, perhaps onboard analog to digital or digital to analog convertors.",True

219,"Many copiers have “walk up sensors” that begin to heat up the fuser, lift the paper in the trays to the feed rollers, check the status of the exit tray if there is a finisher with a high capacity exit tray, and they light up the display.",True
220,"They may run some sort of test on the rollers along the paper path, I’m not sure.",True
221,A hallway is a bad spot to put a modern copier unless you disable the walk up sensor.,True
222,That thing is heating up its fuser every time people walk past.,True
223,I’m surprised the company that sold and services the copier hasn’t disabled that feature if the device is in a hallway.,True
224,"The feature can usually be both disabled, and have the sensitivity adjusted.",True
225,"In addition to being annoying, it also has the potential to reduce the reliability of the copier.",True
226,Fuser rollers do go bad.,True
227,Not as much anymore because of low temperature fusing due to a lower temperature toner but it’s a fact of physics that heating and cooling involves expansion and contraction which is physical wear and tear on the device.,True

Now let's talk about why you would actually use this.",True
479,"This is the tricky part I was talking about, because most examples of this are cryptographic, which is a topic one does not easily ELI5.",True
480,So let's talk about blockchains!,True
481,"There's a lot I'm simplifying here, but for our ELI5 you can imagine a blockchain as a simple registry book that holds all kinds of entries regarding whatever.",True
482,The classic approach to this would be to have a clerk approve every entry before writing it into the book.,True
483,"This is fine for most real-life cases, but on the internet there are some cases where centralization isn't desired.",True
484,Your clerk's internet is dead?,True
485,"Bad luck, you're not getting your entry today.",True
486,"Of course you can introduce redundancy by having backup clerks, but at some point the effort isn't worth it anymore.",True

488,Good luck proving that!,True
489,"[Disclaimer: as far as i know the following is not how current blockchains have implemented PoW and management, but a blockchain *could* be designed this way, and it's a nice example].",True
490,Blockchains are thus designed to be *de*centralized.,True
491,How this works is that a bunch of machines collectively play the clerk role in a democratic way.,True
492,"These are machines from all over the internet, from all kinds of people.",True
493,"There's no entry fee or admission, you connect your machine and you're in.",True
494,"This guarantees that there's no single point of failure (which would be the case if a single entity, for example a company, was managing the machines).",True
495,"As long as some machines stay connected, the blockchain is alive.",True
496,"It also guarantees independance - it's a collective effort, thus no single entity has control over the blockchain.",True
497,"However, this extremely open approach presents another challenge for the blockchain: If there are 500 machines managing a blockchain, any malicious party can just connect 501 extremely weak machines for cheap.",True
498,This would give them the defacto majority and full control over the blockchain's management.,True
499,"And finally, to prevent that from happening, we can come back to proof of work.",True
500,"Proof of work in a blockchain could then mean that each ""vote"" in the democratic management system has to deliver a Proof of Work.",True

527,Hertz measures the refresh rate of the screen itself.,True
528,If a computer monitor is set to 60 Hz that means it can display a maximum of 60 images per second.,True
529,The framerate is the number of frames that the computer can successfully render and send for display in a second.,True
530,That can be considerably more than the refresh rate of the monitor.,True

532,"I don't know how to explain that, but I've felt the same way from time to time.",True
533,Sometimes it can be painfully obvious that the computer has not finished rendering an image before it displays what it has and moves on.,True
534,"This is known as ""screen tearing.""",True
535,"The way to fix it is to use V-sync, which matches the the framerate to the refresh rate.",True
536,FPS = Hz in that case.,True
537,Screen tearing is only noticeable to me when the overall framerate is low.,True
538,"Sometimes a computer can't actually match the refresh rate of the monitor so in V-sync it will cut the number of frames delivered in half or worse, which makes for the unpleasant ""slide show"" experience of low framerate.",True
539,"The easiest and most noticeable way to improve low framerates is to lower the screen resolution, so that the computer is drawing images with fewer pixels in the same amount of time.",True
540,More modern gaming monitors have much higher refresh rates and have recently begun to try to match the refresh rate to the render rate at higher cycles.,True
541,"In that case the GPU is telling the monitor, ""I can deliver this many frames in this amount of time,"" and the monitor says, ""then I'll refresh the screen that many times in that amount of time.""",True
542,The result is supposedly a smoother experience.,True
543,"As I think I know from years and years of gaming, no graphical improvement matters more than framerate.",True

545,A great many people are unaware of this and their gameplay suffers for it.,True
546,The inability to display high-resolution images at high framerate is what has held back virtual reality for thirty years.,True
547,In regular gaming it just means you're going to bring up the rear in online first person shooters.,True

549,"There seems to be some circular discussion going on, so I'll try and start from the top and hopefully clarify things.",True
550,Sampling rate is how many times a second there's a chunk of information.,True
551,A sampling rate of 44kHz means there are 44000 values in the waveform per second.,True
552,"But, because waves and stuff, you can only produce sounds with frequencies up to half the sampling rate.",True
553,"So for 44kHz, the highest possible tone would be 22kHz (which is outside the range of human hearing).",True
554,"For a 22kHz sampling rate, the highest possible pitch would be 11kHz (which is within normal human hearing, but high.",True
555,Plenty of adults would struggle to hear that!).,True
556,The headphones don't really care what the sampling rate is.,True
557,They just have the range of frequencies over which they work.,True
558,"In your case, your headphones can produce sounds up to 28kHz.",True
559,"So, for the sound to be produced by the headphones, it needs to be within the response range of the headphones *and* less than half the sample rate.",True
560,"Say your DAC was at 44kHz, but your headphones were only rated up to 16kHz.",True
561,Then the DAC would be sending frequencies all the way to 22kHz to the headphones.,True
562,But the phones can't do anything with the stuff in the 16-22kHz range.,True
563,They're just not capable of it.,True
564,"From what you've described, your situation is that the DAC is sampling at 44kHz and the phones cap out at 28kHz.",True
565,"This means the DAC is sending 44k samples per second, meaning it can produce frequencies up to 22kHz.",True
566,"The phones are *capable* of making sounds in the 22-28kHz range, but they don't because there's no information in that frequency range reaching them.",True

590,"If they have a consensus, the new block is added and the validators get a portion of the transaction fees for their trouble.",True
591,Proof of stake systems are gaining favor because the reward ownership of coin rather than raw computational power.,True
592,The calculations don't need to get progressively harder - leading to skyrocketing power demands - because validation isn't based on computational power but rather ownership of coin.,True

888,So progressive overload would be adding more weight over time so there is proper stimulus for the muscle to continue growing.,False
889,If one’s goal is to maintain they could continue to lift the same weight in order to maintain the muscle mass they currently have and in that case progressive overload would not be needed as continued muscle growth is not the goal.,False

1236,"Okay, sounds great, inflation problem solved, we can go about our business.",False
1237,Yay!,False
1238,But it's much worse than you think.,False
1239,"What quantitative tightening does is it removes liquidity from the system, which means there's less money for banks to borrow from the federal government, which leads to it being more difficult for businesses to start up or borrow money for capital improvements, which eventually leads to economic stagnation if you let it go on long enough.",False
1240,"Then, when the inflation problem has hit zero and tips into deflation territory, you start thinking, ""Great!",False
1241,"My money is worth more than it was yesterday!""",False
1242,"and then you rationalize this as, ""My money will be worth more tomorrow.",False
1243,I will not spend my money today.,False
1244,"Or tomorrow, because it will be worth more the next day!""",False
1245,and so on and so on.,False
1246,"This is obviously problematic for businesses, because people are now hoarding their money, so the businesses (which still have to pay rent and salaries) start losing money, so they start letting people go, and now you've got an unemployment problem on your hands.",False
1247,"And then, as businesses shut down, new ones don't open in their place because your quantitative tightening policies have made it so banks aren't loaning money to anybody except for companies that already have so much money that they don't need it.",False
1248,"This exact scenario happened in 2008, although it started for reasons unrelated to quantitative tightening.",False
1249,"However, when consumer spending goes down, the first places to go are local restaurants, and it spreads like a cancer from there.",False

1254,It’s hard to explain because when it ‘clicks’ the difficulty becomes forgotten.,False
1255,In your case I think you are overthinking rather than under thinking.,False

1257,Force is what we call matter (mass) as it is accelerated.,False
1258,Does that make sense?,False
1259,If so hang on tight to that.,False
1260,We are going to add the rest to it.,False
1261,So we need a way to describe mass.,False

1264,Next part is where it gets a little tricky.,False
1265,Acceleration is a change in velocity.,False
1266,Let’s say how much it changed in a second.,False
1267,So acceleration is (change in velocity) ‘per’ second also written as (change in velocity)/second.,False
1268,But velocity also has a term.,False
1269,We list it in meters per second.,False
1270,"So acceleration is really (meters per second per second) Or switching that to our more mathy view, meters/sec/sec.",False
1271,"And since that’s a lot to write, let’s just say meters/sec^2.",False
1272,The velocity and change in velocity are in the same second so it is logical to square up.,False
1273,"So now that we built the ‘m’ and ‘a’ parts, let’s put them together.",False
1274,Force is mass times acceleration.,False
1275,"Force is (kilograms, a measurement of mass) times (m/s2, a measurement of acceleration).",False
1276,"Force is kg • m/s2

Just walking through the steps and ideas demonstrates how we arrive at the kg•m/s^2.",False
1277,"We just put in base units from velocity to acceleration to time up to Force, which a derived unit.",False
1278,We get a somewhat unwieldy term.,False
1279,So someone created Newton.,False
1280,My hardest concept (still) is ‘how is there no force if there’s no change in velocity.,False
1281,"I mean, I’m pushing pretty hard on this building, how are you telling me there’s no force?",False
1282,Anyway I probably put too high an expectation on five year olds and someone probably did a better job by now.,False
1283,Good luck.,False
1284,The rainbow is visible as a curve because it's actually a circle around the sun.,False
1285,Basically the entire sky is scattering light but you can only see the rainbow effect in the part of the sky that forms the correct angle from the sun to the sky to your eye.,False
1286,"This is also why rainbows move as you do, they're defined by your positional relationship with the sun, as you move that relative position also moves.",False
1287,"SDR content uses generally 24 bits of information to represent the brightness and color of each pixel (8 bits each for red, green, and blue sub pixels).",False
1288,"HDR allocates more bits (30 or 32 bits per pixel, for HDR10 and Dolby Vision) allowing for more distinct brightness and color values to be represented.",False
1289,This means you have enough info to encode a wider dynamic range (difference between the brightest white and pure black) without losing out on subtle differences between colors and shades.,False
1290,"TLDR: HDR content on an HDR TV can have really bright scenes and really dark scenes, without either getting washed out",False
1291,"Natural magnets work by getting electrons spinning in the same direction, the more electrons spin the same way, the stronger it is

1301,"Or, instead, you could categorize by room: the kitchen, the living room, a bedroom.",False
1302,Categorical thinking means knowing when to group different things together and treat them as a class.,False
1303,One potential problem with categorical thinking is that it blurs differences between the items.,False

1311,"As the plant grows, the radon from fertilizer, along with naturally-occurring radon in surrounding soil and rocks, cling to the sticky hairs on the bottom of tobacco leaves, called trichomes.",False
1312,Radon later decays into the radioactive elements lead-210 and polonium-210.,False
1313,Rain does not wash them away.,False

1365,Combustibility is how well a material will continue to burn (once it is on fire).,False
1366,This has partly to do with whether the fire that's produced by the material has high enough temperature to inflame adjacent material.,False
1367,"Fire is hot, but there are variations in how hot a fire will burn (600 C for wood, 3000 C for acetylene (welding torch) for example).",False

1376,"So basically, when our noses and sinuses get irritated — by an illness or allergies — they do 2 things: they produce more mucus and they become inflamed.",False
1377,"As long as your nose is stuffy, there is a lot less room for mucus to drain out and for air to come in.",False

If you think of a resistor (a load that turns electricity into heat), it does not care whether a positive current or a negative current goes through it, it still produces the same amount of heat either direction.",False
1382,"So when you measure how much heat (power) has been produced, it is always positive, and so working backwards you can calculate the rms voltage.",False
