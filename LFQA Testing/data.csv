47,"(As an ironic side note, ""iūstus"" and ""justice"" sound alike, as do ""just"" and ""iūs"", but the meanings are backwards) So originally, we had a very Latinate adjective coming from a Latin adjective with the same meaning.",True
48,"""Upright, correct, proper"" Then we used it as an adverb meaning similar, ""exactly"" or ""properly"".",True
49,"This lead to the phrase ""just so"" meaning ""exactly so"".",True
50,"From that point, it shifted slightly in meaning to how we typically use it today, to mean ""only, simply"".",True
51,"Which, if you think about it, is how we use it in a lot of the contexts we do.",True
52,"That meaning works well as a weak intensifier, if that description makes sense.",True

64,"When you get to the jazz generation, you get a lot of Harlem Renaissance poets who started performing poetry over jazz.",True
65,"This didn't directly turn into hip-hop either, but it created a kind of precedent that may have directly or indirectly influenced people who would later make hip-hop.",True

101,I think they originally started 10-15 years ago to bother people like Scientology and DDoS them amongst other things.,True
102,There is a video released by them somewhere about them being against Scientology in particular.,True
103,"Dear God, the answers here are terrible.",True
104,The short answer is that there's not a difference.,True
105,"Powerful engines have high power output, meaning horsepower.",True
106,"Torque is a measure of angular force, which means force of twist, or how hard it twists.",True
107,"Horsepower is, mathematically, torque multiplied by revolutions per minute divided by 5252 (just trust the constant, the explanation isn't relevant for this).",True
108,So how to you get high horsepower?,True
109,You use high torque or you have high rpms.,True
110,"High rpms mean more movement, which means more friction and less efficiency.",True
111,"Higher torque means the engine has to be able to take higher internal forces (since torque IS rotational force), which means it's heavier.",True
112,Heavier is often bad for a race car.,True
113,"So the answers about diesel being heavier, but making more torque are right then, right?",True
114,I'm mad over nothing!,True
115,"Well, no.",True
116,"Let's look at the most prolific engine family of all time, the Chevy small block.",True
117,"Specifically, let's look at the 3rd and 4th gen, the LS family.",True
118,The same engines were routinely used BOTH in trucks and Corvettes.,True
119,"Sure, they'd get tweaks to push the horsepower a bit higher in the Corvette, or a bit more low end torque for the LQ (truck designated) engines, but they're ALMOST identical.",True
120,So what gives?,True
121,The definition of torque.,True
122,That's what.,True
123,Torque is force at some distance from the centerline.,True
124,"Basically, if you put a 1lb weight on an arm 1 ft long, you have 1 ft-lb of twist.",True
125,If you double the length?,True
126,The same 1 lb is now doing 2ft-lb of twist.,True
127,"So how's the Corvette, a high performance sports car, using a truck motor that doesn't rev very high?",True
128,One word: gearing.,True
129,"ANY engine can have ANY torque value at the tires, which is where it's measured.",True
130,"As Archimedes said, give me a long enough lever, and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I will move the world.",True
131,Any engine can be a race car engine.,True
132,Any engine can be a truck engine.,True
133,"The energy output per second, or power, is all that matters.",True
134,"With gears, you can reshape your power to be used however you need, speed or grunt.",True
135,So why do semis use diesel?,True
136,Because it's cheaper.,True
137,That's it.,True
138,Diesel is cheaper per used power because diesel is more power dense than gasoline.,True
139,The higher compression ratio is more efficient.,True
140,Glow plugs last longer than spark plugs.,True
141,Diesel engines last longer and are simpler to repair when they do fail.,True
142,The claims on shorter piston movements meaning more power but less efficiency?,True
143,"True, because of friction losses in longer strokes with higher RPM.",True
144,"That higher RPM, we we saw in the equation, means more power.",True
145,TL;DR: there's virtually no difference in the engines.,True
146,The transmissions are where the differences are.,True
147,Diesels are used because they're efficient and reliable.,True
148,"Edit: promptly a complaint about not using metric, so here you go: Power (kW) = Torque (N.m) x Speed (RPM) / 9.5488

If you'd rather use a multiplier of 1/9.5488 instead of 1/5252, be my guest.",True
149,"You can similarly use 1N of force on a 1m and 2m bar, etc.",True
150,I don't care.,True
151,"After a decade as an aerospace engineer, I don't particularly care what anyone's using.",True
152,Say we want to see whether a medicine is effective at preventing heart attack in elderly populations.,True
153,"We see that among those taking the medicine, 5% suffer heart attacks compared to 3% of those who don’t.",True
154,Seems like the medicine is counterproductive right?,True
155,"Say you look deeper in the data and find that among those with high risk factors, 20% of those without the medicine suffer heart attacks compared with 6% that do take the medicine.",True
156,"Meanwhile, among those without high risk factors, 2% who don’t take the medicine suffer heart attacks, while 0.2% who take the medicine do.",True
157,That means the medicine reduced the rate of heart attacks for both high risk and low risk people!,True
158,"However, an overwhelming majority of high risk people take the medicine, compared with maybe half or so of the low risk people.",True
159,"And since high risk people have such a higher baseline of risk, this means that those taking medicine are more likely to get heart attacks than those who don’t even though the medicine itself makes them less likely.",True
160,Tldr: Simpson’s paradox is when a correlation reverses itself once you control for another variable.,True
161,"Earlier post talks about ""risk"" when risk really isn't a factor in T bills.",True
162,US Treasury bills are about the most risk free investment there is.,True
163,"The US government has never, EVER defaulted on a treasury bill, not a single penny.",True
164,"If investment firms were seriously worried that the US government would default within the next 10 years it wouldn't cause an interest rate change, it'd cause a global economic *meltdown*.",True
165,"In fact, the other poster has it wrong.",True
166,Inverted yield curves aren't caused by people wanting *fewer* long term bonds.,True
167,They're caused by them wanting *more*.,True
168,A treasury bill is just you loaning the government money.,True
169,"In an ideal situation, the longer you loan the government money, the more the government ""rewards"" you by increasing the amount paid back.",True
170,Generally.,True
171,This is why *generally* 10 year T bills have a higher interest rate than say..2 year T bills.,True
172,"If you're willing to loan the government your money for *ten* years, you damn well better get MORE out of it than if you only lend it for 2 years.",True
173,"But government T bills are sold on an exchange, and interest rates fluctuate based on supply and demand.",True
174,"When people buy more of them, interest rates drop.",True
175,"When they buy less, interest rates rise to be more competitive and attractive.",True
176,"So when you get an inverted yield curve, what happens is when, typically, a 2 year treasury bond has a higher interest rate than a 10 year bond.",True
177,"This can happen either because:

1)  2 year bonds are in extremely low demand, driving the interest on a 2 year bond UP, or;

2)  10 year bonds are in extremely *high* demand, driving the interest on a 10 year bond *down*.",True
178,So why does an inversion yield curve predict recession?,True
179,"Because if people start thinking the economy is going to tank, driving down stock markets, and destroying their long term investment future, they're going to do the smart move and put their money in the safest place possible to weather that storm.",True
180,"So when people start thinking ""I need to move my money into some place safe because a recession could last a few years"" they stick it in a safe place.",True
181,And there's nothing safer than a US government 10 year treasury bill.,True
182,And when suddenly people are buying up a whole lot of 10 year treasury bills this drives the interest rate down.,True
183,Which can create the inversion.,True
184,Petroleum is a mix of many different hydrocarbon chains (CxHx).,True
185,They're just all dissolved together because they were formed from a mixed soup of biological materials (one source could be energy rich algae in shallow oceans).,True
186,"The heaviest chains are used as tar since the long chains are too heavy to evaporate and are sticky since they get ""tangled"" on each other.",True
187,"The next longest chains tend to be used for things like ""bunker fuel"" or they may be fed into cracking plants to create lighter chained hydrocarbons.",True
188,"The lighter chains (stuff like octane and hexane) can be burned as fuel, while the lightest chains like ethane or propane can be used to create plastic feedstocks (polyethylene or polypropylene).",True
189,"The reason why we use petroleum products as the feedstocks for these instead of synthesizing the substances ourselves from other simple molecules is because the chemistry is more efficient in basically all ways (% reacted, time taken, energy required) when you have a precursor that is already similar to what you're trying to make.",True
190,"Ethylene can be easily formed by simply heating up ethane and propane, so natural gas is the most common source of ethylene and therefore polyethylene.",True
191,"Fertilizer is the odd one out, as what is actually being used is the hydrogen from methane (CH4).",True
192,This easy and cheap source of hydrogen is why fertilizer plants need natural gas.,True
193,The plants heating requirements may also be supplied by burning natural gas.,True
194,The era of the British Empire saw English being spread throughout Asia and Africa due to English colonies.,True
195,"They weren't, for the most part, going to learn the local languages, so they simply had the locals learn English.",True
196,"Then, the American era began after WWII and they sort of reinforced that.",True
197,"**The Belief**: Blue light reminds our brains of daylight, and therefore causes our brains/bodies to produce chemicals that keep us awake

**How glasses work:** Just like any type of light filtering, the glasses are just made of materials that block blue light from passing through them, but still allow other colors to pass through.",True
198,This is usually done by tinting them yellow-ish.,True
199,**In reality**: Probably snake oil.,True
200,"As more information comes out, it's likely that the original studies weren't representative of the actual data and blue light probably doesn't affect anything outside of the margin of error.",True
201,"In the case of your examples - 

Knife, know, knight, kneel all come from Old English/Germanic roots where the K was actually pronounced.",True
202,"The ""kn"" cluster had a unique sound, sort of like how the ""th"" in ""The"" and the ""th"" in ""thistle"" are two different sounds.",True
203,"In ""the"" you use something called ""voice"" meaning your vocal chords are used to make a throaty sound.",True
204,"The ""th"" in ""thistle"" isn't voice, it's a sound purely between your tongue and teeth.",True
205,"In Old English those two sounds used two unique letters that the modern English alphabet has combined in the ""th"" cluster.",True
206,"So in this example, it's an issue of rewriting  Old English/Proto-Germanic sounds using the Latin alphabet and the lose of the pronunciation of ""kn"" started with the French occupation of England around 1056 AD and the French-i-zation of English that occurred.",True
207,"What I'm trying to say is that an English peasant circa 900 AD *would have* said Kuh-Nife and Kuh-neel, and kuh-night.",True
208,"In fact they made fun of this linguistic shift in the Monty Python and the Search for the Holy Grail film when the French ridicule King Arthur's ""Kuh-Niggits"".",True
209,Opossum is a funny outlier here.,True
210,*The 'O' isn't silent*.,True
211,"There are two different animals, ""Opossums"" are a marsupial native to the Americas, they are nocturnal and have hairless tails.",True
212,"The word ""Opossum"" derives form the Indigenous American word for the animal and the O is very much pronounced.",True
213,"A ""Possum"" is an entirely different animal, it looks a bit like a chinchilla, and is native to Australia.",True
214,Totally different animals.,True
215,"I'm not sure why, but many Americans have dropped the ""o"" from Opossum in the pronunciation and either just spell it wrong, or have convinced themselves the O is silent.",True
216,It's not.,True
217,The animal is called the Opossum.,True
218,"> If I had simply bought the stock with all the money I had, versus buying call options with all the money I had, would there be a difference in the end result when I sell the stock?",True
219,"What you seem to be missing is that options are much less expensive than the underlying stocks, so with a given amount of money you can buy more of them.",True
220,For example suppose you have $100 to work with and a single stock costs $100 right now.,True
221,You think this stock will increase in value.,True
222,"You can buy the stock for $100 today and profit by however much it goes up, or you can purchase the option (from the stockholder) to buy the stock for $105 in the future for $5 today.",True
223,Since you have $100 to work with you can purchase 20 options!,True
224,If you bought the stock and it increases in value to $105 then you just made $5.,True
225,Horray!,True
226,If you bought the options then if the stock increases in value to $105 you options aren't worth anything.,True
227,"You have the right to buy at the market price, but you paid $5 for each of the 20 options.",True
228,You lose all of your $100.,True
229,"But, suppose the stock goes higher?",True
230,If you bought the stock and it increases in value to $115 then you just made $15.,True
231,Horray!,True
232,If you bought the options then if the stock increases in value to $115 your options are worth $10 each.,True
233,"You have the option to buy at $105 and immediately sell at $115, gaining $10 for each option.",True
234,"Of course you paid $5 to obtain them so you actually only profit $5 for each, but that means you just made $100 while also recouping your initial $100!",True
235,"So you see with the options you have the possibility of losing a lot of money, but you also have the capacity to make far more money than buying the underlying stocks would allow.",True
236,"The real problem, as I understand it, is that HSV (the herpes virus) can and does hide away within nerve cells in the body, only to reappear months later.",True
237,"So, even if an anti-viral medicine is introduced to the body, it may kill all of the ""obvious"" HSV-infected cells, but not those that are ""hidden away"" inside the nerve cells.",True
238,"It is very unusual behavior for a virus, and thus, medical scientists have had a difficult time come up with a suitable and effective permanent treatment.",True

241,The actual trading happens electronically in the NYSE data centers in NJ.,True
242,"What you're seeing in photos is called ""open outcry"" trading.",True
243,Which is quite literally people shouting out what they're buying and selling.,True
244,"There was a whole lot of noise, so there were collections of hand gestures to communicate.",True

248,"The fish might weigh a lot, but if it’s not fighting then it’s no more difficult than pulling in a 500+pound log.",True
249,Generally the fishing reel is set to allow the line to be pulled out if the fish pulls hard enough.,True
250,That level is adjustable and the idea is to make it as difficult as possible to pull without breaking the line.,True
251,"In this way the fisherman is essentially trying to tire the fish out, until it doesn’t have the strength to pull away anymore.",True
252,"Once the fish is too exhausted to pull away, rather than trying to simply reel it in with a tiny handle the fisherman pulls the rod up to pull the fish closer then drops the point and wheels in the slack they’ve created before pulling the rod up again.",True
253,This continues until the fish is close enough for a net or hook on a pole can be used to scoop the fish out.,True
254,"It was the idea that we had somehow reached a time when all the important history stuff was done, the big wars and conflicts were resolved and new ones almost unimaginable, so some thought that politically, things would just continue to stay roughly the same forever.",True

256,"The Cold War had ended and even Russia was taking steps towards becoming a democratic nation and from a certain point of view, things just looked pretty good and stable, and it was imagine to see what could change that.",True
257,Of course it didn't happen because it was quite a naive idea; there will always be new world events happening.,True
258,"We may not have gotten a new world war (just yet), but we got Covid and Brexit and Russia's annexation of Crimea, and the Trump presidency and January 6 in the US, and 9/11 and climate change and.....

Another criticism of the idea is that it was very eurocentric.",True

530,A good way to tell the difference is by looking at moral dilemmas vs ethical dilemmas and which parties are commonly involved.,True
531,A moral dillema is most commonly an internally driven conflict- where the individual must make a decision based on their own contradicting views.,True
532,An ethical dilemma in contrast generally involves two separate parties disagreeing on what would be the correct moral choice.,True
533,Ethics will generally encapsulate the agreed morals of a particular group- while morals themselves are the individual beliefs that make up those groups.,True

565,"For instance, if someone was excessively doting and sweet and caring, giving you treats and compliments and so on for 2 weeks... and then you find out that they cheated on you 2 weeks ago, then their past behavior was probably love-bombing: trying to make you see them in a positive light, so you'd be more lenient or forgive other bad behavior.",True
566,"It can also done when the person plans to be cruel in the future, so they use flattery to butter you up ahead of time with kindness, so you will trust them more and won't be on-guard for the turnabout, AND so you will 'owe' them your gratitude and mercy/forgiveness.",True

572,The coefficient of friction is a number in physics which represents the ratio of the normal force to the force of friction.,True
573,"The normal force is, for instance, the force pressing on object down against your floor.",True
574,It is the force that pushes two surfaces together.,True
575,Friction is the force that then keeps them from sliding.,True
576,A fifty-pound object would have a normal force of fifty pounds.,True
577,"If its coefficient of friction was 0.5, then it would take 50x0.5 pounds of force to drag it, so 25 pounds of force to drag it.",True

628,"From Old French, the word *bourgeois* meant ""town-dweller,"" and *bourgeoisie* was the ~~plural~~ collective noun.",True
629,"So, at one point, it meant those who lived in the walled market-towns of the age, with the peasants and farmers, living outside the city, relegated to another social stratum.",True
630,"During this time period, the term referred to craftsmen and artisans -- those existing between the peasants and the landlords, who weren't quite ""on top,"" but existed in the middle: the ancient middle class.",True
631,"Nowadays, however, with the ideas of Karl Marx firmly entrenched in the academic space, *bourgeoisie* has come to refer to the economic ruling class; those who own the means of production and exploit the *proletariat,* or the working class -- those who own, and can sell, nothing but their own labor.",True

642,It's waste products aren't as dangerous and don't require long term cooling and containment.,True
643,"It's also a very poor source of fissile material, in other words the bi-products of Thorium reactors can't be made into nuclear weapons.",True
644,This makes the sale of Thorium reactors to other countries far more practical politically.,True
645,So why don't we make them?,True
646,"Billions of dollars of research and development money would be required, and the main source of that would have to be Western Governments.",True
647,But Governments like the US have previous shown no interest in Thorium as a nuclear fuel... because you can't make nuclear weapons out of the by-products.,True
648,This made the RnD for Thorium during the cold war politically undesirable.,True

702,While it is possible to catch parasites from fish when eaten raw its very uncommon qnd when left to decompose in soil the parasites will all either die or be killed by other tiny creatures in the soil.,False
703,A parasite infects its host partly because the host offers an environment suitable for it to grow and reproduce the environment of most species of fish is going to be vastly different than that of a dead fish in dirt or vegetables or a human and not often preferable to humans which is the reason why most parasitic infections in people are from creatures that prefer hosts with land mammal biology and are spread between land mammals usually thru drinking water or food that has been exposed to land mammal excrement or blood or by mosquitos.,False

1250,"Fusion, which is a therapy method of reintegrating alters into a whole, and functional plurality, which is treating the more problematic symptoms and making it just a unique way to live.",False
1251,"Source: multiple friends with DID (some diagnosed, some not.",False
1252,"), And I'm going to be going into the field of mental health eventually.",False
1253,"Often such ""gifts"" aren't just a pile of cold, hard cash that the nation can do anything they want with.",False
1254,"That isn't as politically advantageous as it would relinquish control of what that money can be spent on, and would likely be spent in ways that don't particularly benefit the country giving it.",False
1255,Instead what would often happen is the donating country would provide a certain amount of funds for use in purchasing certain kinds of products from local companies.,False
1256,So for example the United States might provide Ukraine with a budgeted amount of money to spend on purchasing weapons from US-based weapons manufacturers.,False
1257,"That budget would be paid out by the US government itself, not Ukraine, so there isn't really a bank account sitting around with that money in it (other than the US government general fund).",False
1258,The money would ultimately come from US taxpayers of course.,False
1259,Since the country being gifted the funds isn't directly involved it doesn't really matter what happens to their local currency.,False
1260,It is much more politically palatable to do things this way as well because it can be seen as reinvesting in the local economy.,False
1261,">No one was on the floor at the time, so he couldn't have been emulating someone else.",False
1262,Just because nobody was dancing at this exact moment doesn't mean he has never seen anybody dance to music before.,False
1263,"When you take a bunch of measurements on something, principal components analysis looks for variables that all move as the result of one or more underlying factors.",False
1264,"For example, if you take measurements of someone’s body (ie you measure the length of their arms, the length of their legs, width of their wrist, etc) you would see that a lot of those individual measurements are all correlated with one another as a result of being related to one underlying factor, overall body size.",False
1265,PCA helps identify these intercorrellations.,False
1266,"You can use this in a lot of situations to reduce the number of variables you have to work with, ie combine a bunch of variables into one variable that sort of contains them all.",False
1267,It means that you can reasonably and convincingly claim that you didn't know about something.,False
1268,Because eggs contain a lot of protein.,False
1269,"Protein are molecules that are super long, like a rope a mile long.",False
1270,But they are normally curled up tightly into balls so they don't take up a lot of space.,False
1271,"When you heat proteins you change them, it's called ""denaturing"" and it causes them to unwind back into a mile long rope.",False
1272,"Now imagine cooking a thousand balls of rope, all unwinding and bouncing around and moving about.",False
1273,"They get all tangled up and you essentially get a giant mess of tangled ropes, maybe you'd call a mess of tangled ropes a ""net"", maybe.",False
1274,"This net of protein actually acts like a normal net, it catches stuff.",False
1275,"It catches the fats, oils and sugars, and water and traps them.",False
1276,"In a nutshell, this means the egg stops being a liquid, it's now a rubbery solid, because it's all ""trapped on itself"".",False
1277,Fun Fact - denaturing is how fevers work.,False
1278,Our body heats up and the heat causes the proteins in bacterial cells to unwind and scramble themselves.,False
1279,Storing data works by storing two different states in a way that can be read.,False
1280,"In the past we were pretty bad at this, we used cards that either had a hole or didn't have a hole in specific locations a machine could read.",False
1281,Each page could only hold a few bits of information.,False
1282,Then we started storing it on magnetic tape or disks and reading that with a reader head.,False
1283,"These tapes or disks essentially place the ""holes"" far closer together.",False
1284,The holes being an electrical charge.,False
1285,HDDs are basically just the results of a ton of improvements in this.,False
1286,Air masses move around.,False
1287,"One day you're in an air mass that flowed to you via a jet from the deep tropics, the other day you're in an air mass that got pushed down out of the subpolar regions.",False
1288,"It takes a while for an air mass to change temperature/humidity as it moves, so local conditions aren't everything.",False
1289,Fermenting food like milk and fish creates a gas (carbon dioxide and sometimes methane) - this creates the bag to fill up and burst over time.,False
